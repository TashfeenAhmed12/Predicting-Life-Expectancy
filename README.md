# Predicting-Life-Expectancy
Predictive Model to predict Life Expectancy for a Country based on various health and social-economic factors

# Objective

# Framing the Problem
The goal is to develop a predictive model using the Life Expectancy dataset from the World Health Organization (WHO) to estimate life expectancy based on various health factors and socio-economic indicators. This solution will assist healthcare organizations and policymakers in identifying key areas for improvement in public health. According to [National Library of Medicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5387671/#:~:text=3-,Projections%20of%20future%20mortality%20and%20life%20expectancy%20are%20needed%20to,comparison%20of%20a%20few%20models.), projections of future mortality and life expectancy are needed to plan for health and social services and pensions

**Usage**: The solution will be used to analyze trends, identify significant health determinants, and guide policy decisions aimed at improving life expectancy in different countries.

**Current Solutions**: Presently, life expectancy projections are based on statistical analysis and epidemiological models, which may not always incorporate a wide range of socio-economic factors.

**Problem Framing**: This is a supervised learning problem, where the model will be trained with historical data to predict life expectancy. 

**Performance Measurement**: The model's performance can be measured using Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to quantify the prediction accuracy for life expectancy.

The success of this model aligns with the broader goal of improving public health outcomes by providing insights into factors influencing life expectancy, thereby aiding effective policy-making.
